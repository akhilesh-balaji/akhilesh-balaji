### Salute plurimam dicit. Si vales, bene est, ego valeo. I'm Akhilesh Balaji.

My name is Akhilesh Balaji, and I have an interest in Science and Technology. I also dabble in graphic design, at times. I currently study in 8th grade at Neev Academy, India. I have started a science magazine called The Geekly, and also own a science-related YouTube Channel. I am also officially proficient in Python, a programming language. I enjoy science and technology, and I hope to learn many new things about the mysteries of the universe that nature hides from us, and spread this knowledge to others as well.
